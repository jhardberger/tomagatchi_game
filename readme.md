Hi! 

My name is John, I'm a very cool web developer and I like to make games!!!!

Here is a game I made based on the once-popular game-come-90s nostalgia cancer cell TOMAGOTCHI. It works mostly. 

You don't need any special software for this game - you can play it right in your browser! Now that's what I call funcitonality. 

I hope you enjoy this humble game. It will in time improve thanks to the magic of updates. 

Forthcoming features: 

- sprite emotes for the Tomagotchi, with a general bob and more vigorous bobbing for his various levels of entertainment (play method)
-a method that will allow the Tomagotchi to elvove, probably into a large bug because that's what I found sprite art for
-a method that will allow the Tomagotchi to emote, which will be cute
-a game over screen, and possibly some other player feedback (graphic messages when a stat is raised or lowered)
-graphic improvements - more animation, a prettier stat display (I'm thinking stat bars - they're gonna be big!), generally more pleasing, less crappy-homemade-livejournal aesthetic (though some would call that a feature not a bug)
-general debugging
